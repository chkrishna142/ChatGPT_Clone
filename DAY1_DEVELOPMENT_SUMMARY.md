**Complex logic implemented:**

- Find message position in conversation
- Truncate conversation at edit point
- Regenerate all subsequent AI responses
- Maintain conversation context and flow

### **Step 6: File Upload System (30 mins)**

**What we built:**

- Cloudinary integration for secure file storage (`src/app/api/upload/route.ts`)
- File validation (type, size, security checks)
- Support for images (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP) and documents (PDF, TXT, DOCX)
- Drag & drop and click-to-upload interface

**Why it mattered:**

- File upload was a required assignment feature
- Cloudinary provides production-ready file management
- Proper validation ensures security and performance

- CRUD operations demonstrate full-stack development skills
- Chat restoration significantly improves user experience

**APIs created:**

- `GET /api/chats` - Load user's chat history
- `POST /api/chats` - Create new chat
- `PUT /api/chats` - Update existing chat
- `DELETE /api/chats` - Remove chat from database

### **Step 8: Advanced Features & Polish (25 mins)**
